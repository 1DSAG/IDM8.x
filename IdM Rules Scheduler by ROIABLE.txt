IdM Rules Scheduler by ROIABLE
An easy to use web-based application that allows you to view and manage your SAP IdM job rules.
Until now the only option to do that was to follow an SAP Note and make changes directly in the database.
Now, using this tool, you will be able to:
 - view standard SAP and custom rules and job chains
 - create new rules and job chains
 - visualize job executions
 - get details about job rule assignments
 - supported types -> "After another job", "On demand", "Frequency" and "Specific Time"
 
Tested on all SAP IdM supported databases from SAP IdM SP6 onwards.
No additional infrastructure needed, simply install on the same SAP NetWeaver where SAP IdM UI is running.
