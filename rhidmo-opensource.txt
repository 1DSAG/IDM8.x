Rhidmo®

Rhidmo® is a generic implementation of the SAP® Identity Management Extension Framework. It enables developers to build custom SAP® IDM extensions in JavaScript instead of Java, directly from the SAP® Identity Management Developer Studio. This ensures a fast turn around during the development phase of the project. A lot of the standard SAP® IDM built in custom functions are provided as well, giving the IDM developer a familiar environment to enhance the user experience.
